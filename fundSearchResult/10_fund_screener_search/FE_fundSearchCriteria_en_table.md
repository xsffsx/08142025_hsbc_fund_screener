| **Morningstar rating** | For almost funds (funds in some Morningstar categories are not rated) in Hong Kong with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance after adjusted for fees, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. For funds with track records of more than 60 months, the Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. | **All (6)** | • ★★★★★<br/>• ★★★★<br/>• ★★★<br/>• ★★<br/>• ★<br/>• No rating |
