### 1 year quartile ranking
The quartiles divide the data into four equal regions. Expressed in terms of rank (1, 2, 3 or 4), the quartile measure shows how well a fund has performed compared to all other funds in its peer group.

### Average credit quality
The weighted average of all the bond credit ratings in a fund. The measure gives investors an idea of how risky a fund's bonds are overall. The lower the weighted average credit rating, the riskier the bond fund. An individual bond or bond fund's credit quality is determined by private independent rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Their credit quality designations range from high ('AAA' to 'AA') to medium ('A' to 'BBB') to low ('BB', 'B', 'CCC', 'CC' to 'C').

### Morningstar rating
For almost funds (funds in some Morningstar categories are not rated) in Hong Kong with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance after adjusted for fees, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. For funds with track records of more than 60 months, the Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.
