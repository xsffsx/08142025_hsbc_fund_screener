    <reportTitle>New Morningstar Analyst Report - Vanguard Utilities ETF</reportTitle>
    <reportContent>&lt;p&gt;This fund offers the broadest and lowest-cost way to gain access to the U.S. utilities sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;take&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Suitability&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many investors have been drawn to the utilities sector over the last decade-plus, as utilities companies have benefited from strong residential and commercial demand for electricity and have enjoyed cheap debt financing to fund capital projects. In addition, utilities companies benefit from a declining-interest-rate environment, which can boost firms&apos; profitability because regulated rates of return are not frequently adjusted by regulators. Also, investors have viewed utilities companies almost as a hybrid between bonds and stocks--they can&apos;t offer the same growth as equities, but are very stable and very appealing because of their dividend yields. Since interest rates began their secular decline in 2000, utilities have produced nearly double the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index&apos;s total return.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now an inflection point looms. At the start of May 2013, utilities companies&apos; stock prices went into a tailspin and their valuations compressed as investors began to become spooked about sharply higher Treasury rates. Utilities have a long history of underperforming the broader market when interest rates rise. If they do rise, Morningstar&apos;s equity analysts see flat returns ahead for utilities and underperformance relative to other U.S. equity sectors. Obviously, predicting interest-rate movements is highly speculative. And offering more uncertainty right now is the upcoming change in the Federal Reserve Board chairmanship and what impact that might have on quantitative easing programs.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For investors interested in the utilities sector, an exchange-traded fund we recommend is Vanguard Utilities ETF &lt;Ticker&gt;VPU&lt;/Ticker&gt;. The lowest-priced U.S. utilities sector ETF, VPU offers exposure to regulated utilities, diversified utilities, and unregulated power generators. VPU is a suitable satellite holding for investors seeking defensive exposure to the U.S. equity market and dividend income (its yield is 3.7%). It also could serve as a tactical bet on low interest rates and long-term growth in electricity demand.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Investors should note that, according to Morningstar&apos;s equity analysts, VPU currently trades at 98% of the fair value of its weighted holdings, compared with the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index, which trades at 101% of its fair value.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Fundamental View&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Interest rates historically have had a major impact on utilities companies, which tend to outperform other equity sectors in declining-rate environments or low-rate environments. Generally, the higher the yield spread--the difference between utilities companies&apos; dividend yield and 10-year U.S. Treasury rates--the better it is for the price performance of utilities. The yield spread has compressed from nearly 300 basis points in June 2012 to about 180 to 190 basis points now. That compression has concerned investors, who have punished utilities companies. In 2013, the utilities sector has underperformed not just the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index but every other U.S. equity sector as well.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Morningstar&apos;s equity analysts have looked at decades of historical data and concluded that even if interest rates rise to 4%, investors still could see solid, if unspectacular, absolute returns from utilities companies. However, outperformance would not be likely. For outperformance to take place, rates would need to decline or at least flatten.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Another area of concern for regulated utilities companies relates to the target rates of return set by regulators. In several recent rate cases, regulators have set relatively low rates of return for the affected utilities. If that trend continues across the sector, the combination of reduced target rates of return and rising interest rates could pressure utilities companies&apos; earnings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Several other dynamics that utilities sector investors should watch closely include continued-low electricity demand, the impact of low natural gas prices on higher-cost coal and nuclear plants (and broadly, on unregulated power producers). New environmental regulation, which could result in coal plant closures, reduced emissions, and increased capital investments. In the medium term, new environmental regulation could have the effect of taking plants off line and resulting in power shortages, higher power prices, and a boost for diversified utilities and independent power generators over the next five to 10 years.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In order to cope with low power prices in the short run, diversified utilities and independent power producers continue to pursue mergers and acquisitions to improve cost efficiency and geographic diversification and to expand into new growth markets. Good-sized deals in the past several years have included Exelon&apos;s &lt;Ticker&gt;EXC&lt;/Ticker&gt; acquisition of Constellation Energy and NRG Energy&apos;s &lt;Ticker&gt;NRG&lt;/Ticker&gt; acquisition of GenOn Energy. (Another big merger was Northeast Utilities&apos; &lt;Ticker&gt;NU&lt;/Ticker&gt; purchase of NSTAR, but those are both regulated utilities, so the merger had nothing to do with power prices and everything to do with cost efficiencies.) If power prices remain low, industry consolidation likely will continue.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portfolio Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index by owning every stock in the index. This benchmark includes all companies that have a GICS utilities sector classification from the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, which represents 98% of the total U.S. stock market. The index provider follows a modified cap-weighting approach that limits individual constituents to 22.5% of the portfolio. Additionally, the combined weight of all companies over 4.5% may not exceed 45% of the index. This cap-weighting approach allows funds that track this index to conform to IRS requirements that allow them to receive favorable tax treatment. While it&apos;s not surprising that large caps represent the majority of the fund&apos;s assets (54%), mid-caps also represent a significant chunk of the portfolio (38%). As a result, the portfolio&apos;s average market cap is only $13.8 billion. Top subindustry weightings belong to electric utilities (52%), diversified utilities (33%), and gas utilities (8%). Independent power producers and energy traders only account for 4.5% of the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E T F Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund charges a reasonable 0.14% expense ratio, which is lower than its closest peer of any size (Utilities Select Sector SPDR XLU, which levies an annual fee of 0.18%). Partially as a result of its low fees, VPU has tracked its benchmark closely since inception. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Alternatives&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Utilities Select Sector SPDR &lt;Ticker&gt;XLU&lt;/Ticker&gt; is a more liquid, though less diversified, alternative. It invests in all 31 utilities companies in the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Index. This approach gives XLU a stronger large-cap tilt and more concentrated portfolio than VPU. XLU&apos;s top 10 holdings account for more than 57% of its portfolio. Despite its more concentrated portfolio, XLU has not experienced greater volatility than VPU over the past five years. During that period, these funds were nearly perfectly correlated. While XLU&apos;s 0.18% expense ratio is comparable to VPU, its asset base and trading volume are substantially higher, which tends to make it a better option for large traders. XLU also offers a more attractive dividend yield.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;IShares U.S. Utilities &lt;Ticker&gt;IDU&lt;/Ticker&gt; is a more expensive alternative. Its fees take a 0.45% bite out of the fund&apos;s returns each year. For this hefty price, investors get a portfolio of 64 large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks in the Dow Jones Utilities Index. However, more than 95% of IDU&apos;s assets overlap with VPU. IDU also has fewer assets than VPU. Therefore, we&apos;d recommend either VPU or XLU over IDU.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A recently launched and very inexpensive option is Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF &lt;Ticker&gt;FUTY&lt;/Ticker&gt;, which charges 0.12%. However, FUTY has minimal assets and is thinly traded. FUTY tracks a slightly different index from Vanguard Utilities ETF; FUTY tracks the MSCI USA IMI Utilities Index, while VPU tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Utilities 25/50 Index. Fidelity customers with a minimum balance of $2,500 can buy FUTY commission-free, although beginning Feb. 1, 2014, they are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;</reportContent>
