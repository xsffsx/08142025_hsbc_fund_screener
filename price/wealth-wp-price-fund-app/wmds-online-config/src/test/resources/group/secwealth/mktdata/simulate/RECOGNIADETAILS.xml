            <string>Tells Me:  The price may have hit a bottom and seems to be turning around to form a new uptrend</string>
            <string>The Triple Bottom starts with prices moving downward, followed by three sharp lows, all at about the same price level showing a test of a support level. Volume diminishes at each successive low and finally bursts as the price rises above the highest high--a decisive breach of that resistance level. This breakout confirms the pattern as a sign of BULLISH price reversal.</string>
